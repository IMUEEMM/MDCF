# MDCF: Multi-Dimensional Conditional Fusion for High-Fidelity Synthetic Faces in Recognition Tasks


### Face Synthesis Model

- We have detailed the steps of the face synthesis model in [README.md](MDCF-master/README.md).


### Face Recognition Model

- We have detailed the steps of the face recognition model in [README.md](AdaFace-master/README.md) and [README_TRAIN.md](AdaFace-master/README_TRAIN.md).


### Emotion Recognition Model

- We have detailed the steps of the emotion recognition model in [README.md](PyTorch-Classification-Trainer/README.md).


### Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the following open-source projects that inspired this work:

- **DCFace**：Developed by Minchul Kim，Computer Vision Lab Ph.D Student Michigan State University. Repository: https://github.com/mk-minchul/dcface. Our work is built upon their valuable baseline implementation, their pioneering efforts have laid a solid foundation for this project.
